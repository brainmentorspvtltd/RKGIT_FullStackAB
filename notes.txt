Programming
- Procedural
- Object Oriented - follows class and object
- Functional


Java
- Platform Independent
- Statically Typed
- Object Oriented
========================
1. Repeat as it is
2. Experiment
3. Just Write Program
4. Self Programming/Logic Building
========================
First Program in Java
- Every Java Program Starts with a class
- Class name should start with a capital letter
- Class name should be same as file name
- Class name can only start with letters, underscore or dollar sign

To Execute Java Program
- compile 
	- open command prompt
	- type : javac FileName.java
	- javac - compile java code
		- JDK gets executed when we type javac
- interpret
	- type : java ClassName
	- now JRE will get executed
	- JRE has JVM and JVM is responsible for interpreter

- JVM search for main method

Why main is public ?
- we have 4 types of scope in Java
  - public - accessible outside the directory
  - protected - accessible with the help of inheritance
  - default - accessible only within package/folder
  - private - accessible only within the class

Why main is static ?
- static things in java gets loaded with class

Why main is void ?
- because main returns nothing, it's a entry point

Why we pass String args ?
- command line arguments
- it's an array of String type

What is System ?
- System is pre-defined class
  System.out
  System.in
  System.err

What is out ?
- out is an instance/object of PrintStream class
- but defined inside System class

What is println ?
- method of PrintStream class
